Independent IQueryable Include
==============================

A small csharp file meant to be included in your project to provider Include support on any IQueryable.

The class is meant to reproduce the native Expression based Include functionality for strong typing, 
and also ignore child IQueryables that don't support include for Unit Testing scenarios.

The easiest way to get started is to install via NuGet (http://nuget.org/packages/IndependentIQueryableInclude)
